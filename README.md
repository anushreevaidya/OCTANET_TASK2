# OCTANET_TASK2
This code creates a basic to-do list with an input field, an "Add" button, and a list of tasks. Users can add tasks by entering text in the input field and clicking the "Add" button or pressing Enter. Each task item has a "Delete" button to remove it from the list. The styling is done using CSS, and JavaScript is used to handle user interactions and update the list dynamically.
